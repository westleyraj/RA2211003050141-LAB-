# Computer Network Lab Exam Exercise 
## Objective: 
Create and configure a suitable topology for both LAN and WAN using 10-15 computers, routers, and switches. Simulate the transmission of a message from one network to a computer in another network. 

## Procedure: 
## Topology Design:
Design a network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer that includes: 
1.	LAN Configuration: At least 10 computers connected to switches. 
2.	WAN Configuration: Connect the LAN network to another network using 
routers. 
## Network Setup in Cisco Packet Tracer: 
### Add Devices: 
1.	Place and connect 10-15 computers. 
2.	Add necessary switches (at least 2 for the LAN setup). 
3.	Add at least 2 routers for WAN setup. 
### Configure IP Addresses: 
1.	Assign IP addresses to all computers within the LAN. 
2.	Configure router interfaces with appropriate IP addresses. 
3.	Set up routing protocols or static routes as needed for WAN 
communication. 
## Configuration Steps: 
### LAN Configuration: 
1.	Connect computers to the switches. 
2.	Configure IP addresses on each computer. 
3.	Connect switches with each other as needed. 
### WAN Configuration: 
1.	Connect routers to each other. 
2.	Configure router interfaces with IP addresses. 
3.	Set up routing (static or dynamic) to ensure connectivity between the 
LANs. 
## Simulation: 
Send a Message: 
1.	Use the simulation mode in Cisco Packet Tracer. 
2.	Configure and send a message from a computer in one network to a 
computer in another network. 
3.	Capture and verify the message transmission. 
## Documentation: 
### Create a Step-by-Step Procedure Document: 
1.	Outline each step taken in the network configuration and simulation. 
2.	Include commands and settings used during the configuration process. 
### Take Screenshots: 
1.	Capture screenshots of the network topology. 
2.	Capture screenshots showing the successful transmission of the 
message. 
### Save Packet Tracer File: 
1. Save the Packet Tracer file with your completed network configuration and simulation. 
## Upload and Submit:
### GitHub Repository: 
1.	Create a GitHub repository with your register number as the repository name. 
2.	Upload the following files to the repository: 
•	Procedure document (suggested to write in .MD file in github) 
•	Screenshots
•	Packet Tracer file (.pkt) 
3. Ensure that the repository is public or accessible.  
•	Submit the Repository Link: 
1.	Copy the URL of your GitHub repository. 
2.	Submit this URL to Google Classroom as per the submission guidelines.
